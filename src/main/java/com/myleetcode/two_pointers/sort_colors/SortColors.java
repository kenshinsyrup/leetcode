     * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
     *
     * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
     *
     * Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
     * Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
     * Follow up:
     *
     * A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
     * First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
     * Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
