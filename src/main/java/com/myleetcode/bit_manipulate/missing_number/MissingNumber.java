     * Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: [3,0,1]
     * Output: 2
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
     * Output: 8
     * Note:
     * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
