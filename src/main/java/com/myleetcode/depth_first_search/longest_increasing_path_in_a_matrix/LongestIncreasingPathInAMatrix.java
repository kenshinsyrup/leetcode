     * Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.
     *
     * From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: nums =
     * [
     *   [9,9,4],
     *   [6,6,8],
     *   [2,1,1]
     * ]
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: nums =
     * [
     *   [3,4,5],
     *   [3,2,6],
     *   [2,2,1]
     * ]
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
