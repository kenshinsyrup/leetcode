     * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
     *
     * Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
