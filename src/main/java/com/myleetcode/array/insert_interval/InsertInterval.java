     * Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).
     *
     * You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
     * Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
     * Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
     * Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
     * NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.
