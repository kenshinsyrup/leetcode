     * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
     *
     * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
     *
     * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: 2, [[1,0]]
     * Output: true
     * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
     *              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
     * Output: false
     * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
     *              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
     *              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
     * Note:
     *
     * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
     * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
