     * Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
     *
     * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
     *
     * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
     *     Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
     * Note:
     *
     * You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
