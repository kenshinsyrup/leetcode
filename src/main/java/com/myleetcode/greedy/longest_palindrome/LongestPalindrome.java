     * Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
     *
     * This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
     *
     * Note:
     * Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input:
     * "abccccdd"
     *
     * Output:
     * 7
     *
     * Explanation:
     * One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
