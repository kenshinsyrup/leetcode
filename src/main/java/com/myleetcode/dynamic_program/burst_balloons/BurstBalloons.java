     * Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
     *
     * Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
     * 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: [3,1,5,8]
     * Output: 167
     * Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
     *              coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
