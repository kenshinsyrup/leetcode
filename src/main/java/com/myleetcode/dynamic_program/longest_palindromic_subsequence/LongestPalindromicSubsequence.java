     * Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input:
     *
     * "bbbab"
     * Output:
     * 4
     * One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
     * Example 2:
     * Input:
     *
     * "cbbd"
     * Output:
     * 2
     * One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
