     * Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
     *
     * Note:
     * If n is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:
     *
     * 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
     * 1 ≤ m ≤ min(50, n)
     * Examples:
     *
     * Input:
     * nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
     * m = 2
     *
     * Output:
     * 18
     *
     * Explanation:
     * There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
     * The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
     * where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
