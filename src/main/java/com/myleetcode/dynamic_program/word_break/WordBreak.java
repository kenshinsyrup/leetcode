     * Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
     * You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
     * Output: true
     * Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
     * Output: true
     * Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
     *              Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
     * Example 3:
     *
     * Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
     * Output: false
