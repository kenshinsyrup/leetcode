 * Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.
 *
 * If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"
 * Output: "bcde"
 * Explanation:
 * "bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
 * "deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
 * The length of S will be in the range [1, 20000].
 * The length of T will be in the range [1, 100].
