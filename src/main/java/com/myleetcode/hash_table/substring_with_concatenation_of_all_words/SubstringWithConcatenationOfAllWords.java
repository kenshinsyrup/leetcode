     * You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input:
     *   s = "barfoothefoobarman",
     *   words = ["foo","bar"]
     * Output: [0,9]
     * Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
     * The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input:
     *   s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
     *   words = ["word","good","best","word"]
     * Output: []
