     * Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.
     *
     * The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: "123"
     * Output: "121"
     * Note:
     * The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
     * If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
