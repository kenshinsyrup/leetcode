     * Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: 38
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2.
     *              Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
     * Follow up:
     * Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
