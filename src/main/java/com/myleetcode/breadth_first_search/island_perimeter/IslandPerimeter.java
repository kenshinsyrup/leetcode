     * You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
     *
     * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
     *
     * The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
     *

     * Example:
     *
     * Input:
     * [[0,1,0,0],
     *  [1,1,1,0],
     *  [0,1,0,0],
     *  [1,1,0,0]]
     *
     * Output: 16
     *
     * Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
