     * Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.
     *
     * After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.
     *
     *
     *
     * (Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
     * Output: [3,1]
     * Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
     * Output: [1,2,4]
     * Example 3:
     *
     * Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
     * Output: [1]
     *
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
     * Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
