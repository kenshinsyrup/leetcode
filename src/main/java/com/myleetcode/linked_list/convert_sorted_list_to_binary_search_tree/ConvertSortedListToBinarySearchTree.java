     * Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
     *
     * For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
     *
     * One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
     *
     *       0
     *      / \
     *    -3   9
     *    /   /
     *  -10  5
