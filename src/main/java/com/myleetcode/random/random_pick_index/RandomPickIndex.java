     * Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
     *
     * Note:
     * The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
     * Solution solution = new Solution(nums);
     *
     * // pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
     * solution.pick(3);
     *
     * // pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
     * solution.pick(1);
