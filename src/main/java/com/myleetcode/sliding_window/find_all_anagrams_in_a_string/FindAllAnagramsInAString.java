     * Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
     *
     * Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.
     *
     * The order of output does not matter.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input:
     * s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"
     *
     * Output:
     * [0, 6]
     *
     * Explanation:
     * The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
     * The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input:
     * s: "abab" p: "ab"
     *
     * Output:
     * [0, 1, 2]
     *
     * Explanation:
     * The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
     * The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
     * The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
