# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Sort the distinct salary in descend order and then utilize the LIMIT clause to get the second highest salary.

# SELECT DISTINCT
#     Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
# FROM
#     Employee
# ORDER BY Salary DESC
# LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
# However, this solution will be judged as 'Wrong Answer' if there is no such second highest salary since there might be only one record in this table. To overcome this issue, we can take this as a temp table.
