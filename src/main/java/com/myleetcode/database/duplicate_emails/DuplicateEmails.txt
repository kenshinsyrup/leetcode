# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Duplicated emails existed more than one time. To count the times each email exists, we can use the following code.

# select Email, count(Email) as num
# from Person
# group by Email;
# | Email   | num |
# |---------|-----|
# | a@b.com | 2   |
# | c@d.com | 1   |
# Taking this as a temporary table, we can get a solution as below.

# select Email from
# (
#   select Email, count(Email) as num
#   from Person
#   group by Email
# ) as statistic # Every derived table must have its own alias
# where num > 1
# ;

SELECT Email
FROM
(
    SELECT Email, COUNT(Email) AS num
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY Email
) AS Statistic
WHERE num > 1;
