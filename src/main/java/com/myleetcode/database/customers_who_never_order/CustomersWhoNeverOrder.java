     * Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.
     *
     * Table: Customers.
     *
     * +----+-------+
     * | Id | Name  |
     * +----+-------+
     * | 1  | Joe   |
     * | 2  | Henry |
     * | 3  | Sam   |
     * | 4  | Max   |
     * +----+-------+
     * Table: Orders.
     *
     * +----+------------+
     * | Id | CustomerId |
     * +----+------------+
     * | 1  | 3          |
     * | 2  | 1          |
     * +----+------------+
     * Using the above tables as example, return the following:
     *
     * +-----------+
     * | Customers |
     * +-----------+
     * | Henry     |
     * | Max       |
