# Write your MySQL query statement below

# If we have a list of customers who have ever ordered, it will be easy to know who never ordered.

# We can use the following code to get such list.

# select customerid from orders;
# Then, we can use NOT IN to query the customers who are not in this list.

# MySQL

# select customers.name as 'Customers'
# from customers
# where customers.id not in
# (
#     select customerid from orders
# );


SELECT Name AS Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE Customers.Id NOT IN
(
    SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders
);
