     * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
     *
     *
     *
     * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
     *
     * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: 4
     * Output: [
     *  [".Q..",  // Solution 1
     *   "...Q",
     *   "Q...",
     *   "..Q."],
     *
     *  ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
     *   "Q...",
     *   "...Q",
     *   ".Q.."]
     * ]
     * Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
