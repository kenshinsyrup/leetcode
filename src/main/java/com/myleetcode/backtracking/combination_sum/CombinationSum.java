     * Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.
     *
     * The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
     * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
     * A solution set is:
     * [
     *   [7],
     *   [2,2,3]
     * ]
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
     * A solution set is:
     * [
     *   [2,2,2,2],
     *   [2,3,3],
     *   [3,5]
     * ]
