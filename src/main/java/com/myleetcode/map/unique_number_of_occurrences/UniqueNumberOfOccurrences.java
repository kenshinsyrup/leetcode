     * Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
     * Output: true
     * Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: arr = [1,2]
     * Output: false
     * Example 3:
     *
     * Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
     * Output: true
     *
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
     * -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000
