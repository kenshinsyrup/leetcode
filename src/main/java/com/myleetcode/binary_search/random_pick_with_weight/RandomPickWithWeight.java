     * Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * 1 <= w.length <= 10000
     * 1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
     * pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input:
     * ["Solution","pickIndex"]
     * [[[1]],[]]
     * Output: [null,0]
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input:
     * ["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
     * [[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
     * Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
     * Explanation of Input Syntax:
     *
     * The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
