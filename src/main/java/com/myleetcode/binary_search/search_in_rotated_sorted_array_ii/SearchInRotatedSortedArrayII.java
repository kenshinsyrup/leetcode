     * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
     *
     * (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).
     *
     * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
     * Output: true
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
     * Output: false
     * Follow up:
     *
     * This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
     * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
