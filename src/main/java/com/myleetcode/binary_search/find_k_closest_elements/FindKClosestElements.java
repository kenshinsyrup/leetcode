     * Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
     * Output: [1,2,3,4]
     * Example 2:
     * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
     * Output: [1,2,3,4]
     * Note:
     * The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
     * Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 104
     * Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 104
     * UPDATE (2017/9/19):
     * The arr parameter had been changed to an array of integers (instead of a list of integers). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
