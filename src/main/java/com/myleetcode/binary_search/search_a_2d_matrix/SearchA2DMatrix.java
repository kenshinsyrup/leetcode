     * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
     *
     * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
     * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input:
     * matrix = [
     *   [1,   3,  5,  7],
     *   [10, 11, 16, 20],
     *   [23, 30, 34, 50]
     * ]
     * target = 3
     * Output: true
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input:
     * matrix = [
     *   [1,   3,  5,  7],
     *   [10, 11, 16, 20],
     *   [23, 30, 34, 50]
     * ]
     * target = 13
     * Output: false
