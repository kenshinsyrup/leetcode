     * Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * Given target value is a floating point.
     * You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
     *
     *     4
     *    / \
     *   2   5
     *  / \
     * 1   3
     *
     * Output: 4
