     * Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
     *
     * Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
     *
     *       5
     *      / \
     *     4   8
     *    /   / \
     *   11  13  4
     *  /  \      \
     * 7    2      1
     * return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
