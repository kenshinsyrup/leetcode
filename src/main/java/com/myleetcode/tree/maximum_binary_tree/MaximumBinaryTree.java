     * Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:
     *
     * The root is the maximum number in the array.
     * The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
     * The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.
     * Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
     * Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:
     *
     *       6
     *     /   \
     *    3     5
     *     \    /
     *      2  0
     *        \
     *         1
     * Note:
     * The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].
