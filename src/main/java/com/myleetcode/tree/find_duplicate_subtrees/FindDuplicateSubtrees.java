     * Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.
     *
     * Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     *         1
     *        / \
     *       2   3
     *      /   / \
     *     4   2   4
     *        /
     *       4
     * The following are two duplicate subtrees:
     *
     *       2
     *      /
     *     4
     * and
     *
     *     4
     * Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.
