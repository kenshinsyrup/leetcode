     * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
     *
     * Note:
     * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
     *    3
     *   / \
     *  1   4
     *   \
     *    2
     * Output: 1
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
     *        5
     *       / \
     *      3   6
     *     / \
     *    2   4
     *   /
     *  1
     * Output: 3
     * Follow up:
     * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
