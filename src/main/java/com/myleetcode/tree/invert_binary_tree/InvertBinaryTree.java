     * Invert a binary tree.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input:
     *
     *      4
     *    /   \
     *   2     7
     *  / \   / \
     * 1   3 6   9
     * Output:
     *

     * 9   6 3   1
     * Trivia:
     * This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
     *
     * Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
