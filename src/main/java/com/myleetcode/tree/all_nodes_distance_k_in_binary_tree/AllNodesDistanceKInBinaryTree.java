     * We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.
     *
     * Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2
     *
     * Output: [7,4,1]
     *
     * Explanation:
     * The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
     * have values 7, 4, and 1.
     *
     *
     *
     * Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
     * The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.
     *
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * The given tree is non-empty.
     * Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
     * The target node is a node in the tree.
     * 0 <= K <= 1000.
