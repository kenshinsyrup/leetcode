     * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
     *
     * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
     *
     * Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
     * Output: 6
     * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
     *
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
     * p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
