     * Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
     *
     * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
     *
     * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
     * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
     * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
     *
     *
     * For example:
     * Given BST [1,null,2,2],
     *
     *    1
     *     \
     *      2
     *     /
     *    2
     *
     *
     * return [2].
     *
     * Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.
     *
     * Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
