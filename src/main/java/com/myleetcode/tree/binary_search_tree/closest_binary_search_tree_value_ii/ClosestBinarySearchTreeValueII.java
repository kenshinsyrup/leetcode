     * Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
     *
     * Note:
     *
     * Given target value is a floating point.
     * You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
     * You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, and k = 2
     *
     *     4
     *    / \
     *   2   5
     *  / \
     * 1   3
     *
     * Output: [4,3]
     * Follow up:
     * Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
