     * Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.
     *
     * Note:
     * A subtree must include all of its descendants.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
     *
     *    10
     *    / \
     *   5  15
     *  / \   \
     * 1   8   7
     *
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one.
     *              The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
     * Follow up:
     * Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?
