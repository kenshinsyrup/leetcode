     * Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input:
     *
     *    1
     *     \
     *      3
     *     /
     *    2
     *
     * Output:
     * 1
     *
     * Explanation:
     * The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
     *
     *
     * Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.
