     * Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
     *
     * Recover the tree without changing its structure.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: [1,3,null,null,2]
     *
     *    1
     *   /
     *  3
     *   \
     *    2
     *
     * Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
     *
     *    3
     *   /
     *  1
     *   \
     *    2
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]
     *
     *   3
     *  / \
     * 1   4
     *    /
     *   2
     *
     * Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
     *
     *   2
     *  / \
     * 1   4
     *    /
     *   3
     * Follow up:
     *
     * A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward.
     * Could you devise a constant space solution?
