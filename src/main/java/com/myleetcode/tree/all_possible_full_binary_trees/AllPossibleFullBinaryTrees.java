     * A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
     *
     * Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.
     *
     * Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.
     *
     * You may return the final list of trees in any order.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: 7
     * Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
